## A simple example to understand the concept of order list and unorder list 
1. <ol></ol> Tag: This is used to print an order list.

2. <ul></ul> Tag: This is used to print an unorder list.

3. <li></li> Tag: This is used to write the text in the list(Order List or Unorder List).

4. start Attribute: This attribute is used to print the number from where you want for example: The list is start from 1 by default but if in case you want to print the list from 4 as I have done my example so you can also do that in the same way like I did and you can start from any number.

5. type Attribute: This attribute is used to print the numbering in any type like 1 or I or A or i or a in order list. For unorder list you print like square or disc or circle
